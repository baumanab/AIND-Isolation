    "Three scoring functions were developed for the isolation tournaments to compete against the ID_improved scoring function.  The ID_improved scoring function scores each game state using the difference of the primary agent moves and the opponent moves.  That is, agent_moves - opponent_moves.  This favors states in which the primary agent has more options to move than its opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Student Agent Scoring Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weighted Move Differences**: This is similiar to the ID improved scoring function but weights the opponent moves by an optional argument supplied by the user.  The default argument is 2 meaning that 2 times the opponents move number will be subtracted from the primary agent move number.  This heavily favors states in which the opponent has less moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Center Weighted Moves**:  This adds a term to weighted moves differences which favors moves to the center with a user supplied center_weight argument. The default center_weight is 2, favoring moves to the center by the primary agent by 2-fold and penalizing opponent moves to the center by 2-fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Center Weighted Moves with Decay**:  This adds a decay term to the center weighted moves scoring function which diminishes the center_weight term as spaces are blocked. The rationale for this was arrived at by playing and reading about isolation. A very succesful strategy is to create islands of squares where both players moves on a seperate island. The biggest island wins. "

    "### Evaluation\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring function could be improved in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "- optimize decay function\n",
    "- optimize both weight terms by collecting data with a variety of weights and performing a regression analysis\n",
    "- add a term to further enhance the creation of an island early in the game and staying there. That is, put in some terms where the primary agent distances itself from its opponent and sticks on an island with the most moves. This is pretty complex. I imagnine a scenario where we use reinforement learning where we allow our agent to evaluate the utility of sampled states and develop its own strategy."
